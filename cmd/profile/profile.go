Device profiles describe the attributes of a common class of devices 
managed by a specific DS. A device profile is made up of one or more 
device resources, optional resources, and optional commands. 
Commands are added to Core Metadata, and are used to validate REST API 
requests made to Core Command's command endpoint.
