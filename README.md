# edgex-cli

## Introduction

A command line interface to interact with EdgeX microservices. Replaces the need to manually construct complex CURL commands and/or maintain developer scripts.

## Installation

In order to run this tool, you will need a **locally running EdgeX instance**, accessible via localhost,
and Go 1.12 or higher installed on your machine.

* Clone the git repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-cli
```

* Change directory:

```
$ cd edgex-cli
```

* Install the CLI:

```
$ make install
```
Install also makes a copy of the default configuration and copies it to $HOME/.edgex-cli/configuration.toml.
If your EdgeX instance is not running on localhost, minimally you will need to replace localhost with the correct IP address.
You can now use the CLI by entering `edgex-cli` anywhere on your machine provided your $GOBIN is on your $PATH.


#### Interactive Mode

Some commands leverage interactive-mode which opens an editor and allows you to provide information that would 
normally be difficult with just command line arguments. For example, creating an Event requires a lot of information,
also Events contain zero or more readings. Using interactive mode, you can easily create an Event with many readings and 
customize each reading. You can choose the editor that is used by setting the environment variable `EDITOR`. The default
editor is `Vi` for `Unix` operating systems(MacOS, Linux, etc), `Notepad` for Windows OS. The default editor is used if 
no `EDITOR` is specified. Some examples of editors:

- vi
- vim
- nano
- emacs
- notepad
- vscode
- atom


### CLI Developers 

To try out your changes you have two options, one using 'make build', the other 'go run'. Also, we share how to launch tests.

* Build and run:

```
$ make build
$ ./edgex-cli
```

* Use `go run`:

```
$ go run main.go [COMMAND]
```

* Running tests:

```
$ make test
```

This will generate the file coverage.out in the repository root directory. TO view the results, execute:

```
$ go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

#### Code Organization
All CLI go code lives under the "cmd" directory. Its sub-directories map to the supported toplevel commands, such as 
addressable, command, db, device, ... version. To obtain a full list of supported commands type 'edgex-cli --help'.

Our convention has been to use the -f flag to pass in a file argument.  -n is typically used to provide a name. 
Both command specific and global flags exist. 
Refer to the Cobra (https://godoc.org/github.com/spf13/cobra) and Viper (https://godoc.org/github.com/spf13/viper) documentation for additional help.


#### Sample Templates
The "samples" directory holds templates for device profile (createDP.json and yaml),
device (createDevice.toml), intervals (createInterval.toml and json), and for updateInterval. 
CLI in Interactive mode opens the relevant template in the configured editor.

Edit these should data structures change. 
For legacy reasons we support multiple formats in the case of some objects. Going forward most likely only json format will be supported.
