## Introduction

A command line interface to interact with EdgeX microservices. Replaces the need to manually construct complex CURL commands and/or maintain developer scripts.

`edgex-cli` is being updated to support the V2 API and the documentation will be updated in due course. See the [EdgeXFoundry CLI documentation](https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/1.3/getting-started/tools/Ch-CommandLineInterface/) for more information about the V1.3 (Hanoi) client.
