## Installation

In order to run this tool, you will need an accessible **running EdgeX instance** running locally, accessible via localhost.
 and Go 1.12 or higher installed on your machine.

* Clone the git repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-cli
```

* Change directory:

```
$ cd edgex-cli
```

* Install the CLI:

```
$ make install
```
Install also makes a copy of the default configuration and copies it to $HOME/.edgex-cli/configuration.toml.
If your EdgeX instance is not running on localhost, minimally you will need to replace localhost with the correct IP address.
You can now use the CLI by entering `edgex-cli` anywhere on your machine provided your $GOBIN is on your $PATH.


#### Interactive Mode

Some commands leverage interactive-mode which opens an editor and allows you to provide information that would 
normally be difficult with just command line arguments. For example, creating an Event requires a lot of information,
also Events contain zero or more readings. Using interactive mode, you can easily create an Event with many readings and 
customize each reading. You can choose the editor that is used by setting the environment variable `EDITOR`. The default
editor is `Vi` for `Unix` operating systems(MacOS, Linux, etc), `Notepad` for Windows OS. The default editor is used if 
no `EDITOR` is specified. Some examples of editors:

- vi
- vim
- nano
- emacs
- notepad
- vscode
- atom

### Developers

Follow the installation instructions to create a configuration file and edit as necessary.
To try out your changes, you can either build the binary and execute or by calling `go run`.

* Build and run:

```
$ make build
$ ./edgex-cli
```

* Use `go run`:

```
$ go run main.go [COMMAND]
```

* Running tests:

```
$ make test
```

This will generate a coverage.out file in the root directory of the repo which you can use to see test coverage of code by running

```
$ go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```
